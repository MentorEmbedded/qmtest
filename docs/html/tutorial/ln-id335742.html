 as follows:
  </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Copyright © 2000, 2001 by CodeSourcery LLC.  This

 portion of an Open Publication work with other works or programs on

 works. The aggregate work shall contain a notice specifying the
 inclusion of the Open Publication material and appropriate copyright
 notice.</p><p>SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be
 unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the

    or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your
    intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript
    or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated
    documents. This notification should describe modifications, if
    any, made to the document.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All substantive modifications (including deletions) be
    either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an
    attachment to the document.</p></li></ol></div><p>
 </p><p>Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is
 considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM
 expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its
 author(s).</p></blockquote></div></div></body></html>
